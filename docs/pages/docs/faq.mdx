<FAQBox title="How does Quint compare to fuzzing?">
Main similarities:
- It is possible to get fuzz tests out of Quint
- Both require some sort of property to check

Main differences:
- Writing a Quint model is very different from setting up a fuzzer
- Fuzzers can fail to find rare bugs, while `quint verify` will always find issues if there are any.

<FAQBox title="Why learn Quint if I can write the same in my project's programming language?">

Adding a new language to an ecosystem often finds resistance, and you might be
tempted to use Python or Typescript or whatever you already know. It is possible
to write a reference implementation in some language and then implement some
simulation for it, looking for bugs. Here are some reasons to use Quint instead of that:
- Quint is a specification language. It is more restrictive so you are forced to
  write things in a way that's possible to *formally verify* your model. It is
  very hard to formally verifying arbitrary code in programming languages.
- Quint already has a simulator! We are on the path to making it the best
  simulator ever. While it is probably not there yet, it's likely better than
  something you'll hack in a couple of weeks. If your project's focus is not
  writing a simulator, you might want to use ours.

<FAQBox title="Should I replace my specs in Markdown with Quint ones?">
Yes, and you probably want to use [Literate Specifications](./literate.md) to interleave Quint blocks with natural language descriptions.

While Markdown accepts all sorts of errors, Quint specs are executable. You get
name resolution and type checking for your spec, even if you don't want to run
it. This means you'll get rid of ambiguity, references to names that are never
defined and incompatible interfaces - which are the biggest problems in common
specifications.

<FAQBox title="What are spells?">
  Spells are simply Quint modules that contain often-used definitions. There is
  nothing special about these definitions. They are probably a bit more
  thought-out than a definition someone would write on the spot. Check the page
  on [Spells][].
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="What is the difference between pure def and def?">

Definitions that are tagged as `pure def` are not allowed to read state
variables (that is, the names declared with `var`). Definitions that are tagged
with `def` are allowed to read state variables, though they do not have to.

Pure definitions have the following important property: A **pure definition
always returns the same result for the same parameter values**.

Consider the following operator definition:

```quint
pure def min(x, y) = if (x < y) x else y
```

Whenever we call `min(2, 3)`, we get `2` as a result, no matter what the values of state variables are.

Impure definitions have the following important property:
**An impure definition may produce different results for the same parameter
values**. An impure definition **may read** the values of state variables, which
may effect in different results.

Consider the following definitions:

```quint
var limit: int

def minWithLimit(x, y) = min(min(x, y), limit)
```

In the above example, `minWithLimit(10, 20)` produces the value `10`, when
`limit == 100`, whereas `minWithLimit(10, 20)` produces the value `5`, when
`limit == 5`.

</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="What is the difference between val and def?">
The definitions that have at least one parameter should be tagged with `def`,
whereas the definitions that have no parameters should be tagged with `val`. We
could say that `val`'s are nullary `def`'s.

As a result, a `pure val` is never changing its value in an execution. For example:

```quint
pure val avogadro = 602214076^(23 - 8)
```

Note that an impure `val` may still depend on the value of a state variable.
For example:

```quint
var time: int
var velocity: int

val distance = velocity * time
```

In the above example, `distance` does not need any parameters, as it only
depends on the state variables. However, the value of `distance` is still
changing with the values of `time` and `velocity`.

</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="What is the difference between pure val and const?">
A value that is defined via `pure val` is constant in the sense that it never
changes in an execution. A `const` definition also declares a constant value.
However, the value of `const` is not fixed at the time of specification writing,
but it has to be fixed by instantiating the module.  

Here is an example that illustrates the difference between `pure val` and `const`:

```quint
module fixed {
  // this module is written for N=4, e.g., for N processes
  pure val N = 4

  pure val procs = 1.to(N)
  // etc.
}

module parameterized {
  // this module is written for a parameter N
  const N: int

  pure val procs = 1.to(N)
  // etc.
}

module instance4 {
  import parameterized(N = 4) as I

  pure val procs = 1.to(I::N)
}
```
