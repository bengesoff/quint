# Frequently Asked Questions
Here you can find answers to the questions that are often asked by people who
would like to start with Quint.

<br />

<FAQBox title="How does Quint compare to fuzzing?">
Main similarities:
- It is possible to get fuzz tests out of Quint
- Both require some sort of property to check

Main differences:
- Writing a Quint model is very different from setting up a fuzzer
- Fuzzers can fail to find rare bugs, while `quint verify` will always find issues if there are any.
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Why learn Quint if I can write the same in my project's programming language?">

Adding a new language to an ecosystem often finds resistance, and you might be
tempted to use Python or Typescript or whatever you already know. It is possible
to write a reference implementation in some language and then implement some
simulation for it, looking for bugs. Here are some reasons to use Quint instead of that:
- Quint is a specification language. It is more restrictive so you are forced to
  write things in a way that's possible to *formally verify* your model. It is
  very hard to formally verifying arbitrary code in programming languages.
- Quint already has a simulator! We are on the path to making it the best
  simulator ever. While it is probably not there yet, it's likely better than
  something you'll hack in a couple of weeks. If your project's focus is not
  writing a simulator, you might want to use ours.

<FAQBox title="Should I replace my specs in Markdown with Quint ones?">
Yes, and you probably want to use [Literate Specifications](./literate.md) to interleave Quint blocks with natural language descriptions.

While Markdown accepts all sorts of errors, Quint specs are executable. You get
name resolution and type checking for your spec, even if you don't want to run
it. This means you'll get rid of ambiguity, references to names that are never
defined and incompatible interfaces - which are the biggest problems in common
specifications.

<FAQBox title="How does Quint compare to TLA+?">

Quint is based on TLA+ and uses the same underlying logic (Temporal Logic of
Actions), so it is very similar to TLA+ in terms of where it is useful. The main
differences between Quint and TLA+ are:
1. Quint has programming-style syntax, while TLA+ uses math/latex symbols.
2. Quint has more static analysis, such as type checking and different modes
   (`pure def`, `action`, etc), while TLA+ has no native support for types nor
   explicit distinction between the modes (or levels, as they are called in
   TLA+'s documentation).
3. Quint tooling is more similar to what we have for programming languages:
   near-instant feedback as you type the code, CLI-first executable, an easy way
   to obtain one execution of your spec in the terminal, a REPL, located error
   messages, etc. These are all not currently available in TLA+, or available
   with significant constraints.
4. Quint won't let you write many things that are allowed in TLA+. TLA+ has a
   proof system (TLAPS), while Quint doesn't. Therefore, it is possible to write
   more advanced formulas in TLA+ than in Quint, even ones that are not
   supported by the existing model checkers, and then prove them using the proof
   system. Quint restricts you to a fragment of TLA with the intention of
   preventing unintentional usage of operators that lead to complicated
   behaviors that are hard to debug and understand. Our understanding is that
   anything outside of Quint's fragment is only written by people with a strong
   mathematical mindset, and those people will probably appreciate TLA+'s
   mathematical syntax much better.
5. Quint has the concept of a `run` to define executions to be used as tests.
   There is no corresponding feature in TLA+.
6. TLA+ has model values and symmetry sets, which are not available in Quint at
   this time.

On a less concrete note, TLA+ supporters will often say that the mathematical
syntax helps to put people in the correct mindset of formal specification,
while Quint as a project hopes to teach people this mindset without a big syntax
and tool disruption.
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Is Quint the same thing as PlusCal?">
No. Although both Quint and PlusCal have the goal of making TLA+ more
approachable to engineers, the strategies are very different. PlusCal uses the
same tooling and similar syntax to TLA+, but introduces imperative constructs
(while TLA+ is fully declarative). Quint, on the other hand, introduces new
tooling and syntax, but keeps the declarative aspect.

It would be possible to add the imperative constructs from PlusCal to Quint. We
currently don't have a lot of clarity on how useful that would be.

We experienced situations where the expressiveness constraints imposed by PlusCal were a
problem for some of our systems, while Quint has always been enough.

<FAQBox title="How does Quint compare to Alloy?">

Alloy is very focused on sets, and is good for specifying requirements and data
structures, while Quint is natively time oriented, fitting really well with
concurrent and distributed systems. As everything in Alloy is a set/relation, it
requires a quite abstract and specific way of modeling.

While Alloy 6 added temporal operators, for the longest time,
handling the passage of time required complex workarounds, and
therefore having the language be used mostly for other things.

Alloy verification can be faster than Quint for specifications without time, as
it can use SAT solving instead of SMT solving, and the tooling looks very
different, with Alloy Analyzer being very visual.

<FAQBox title="How does Quint compare to Coq/Isabelle/Lean?">
Coq, Isabelle and Lean are proof assistants. They will assist you to write a
proof, but you still have to do most of the work. Quint uses model checking,
where you only need to define the model and the properties, and the verification
process is fully automated. Learning and mastering how to use a proof assistant
is much harder (usually taking years) than learning and mastering Quint.

Proof assistants require you to write deductive proofs, while model checkers (as
in Quint), use an inductive approach, exploring all reachable states in a model.
Proof assistants are mostly used for research, and model checking techniques are
more present in the industry. Some instances of proof assistants in the industry
do exist, as some properties of [DemiBFT (formerly
LibraBFT)](https://github.com/novifinancial/LibraChain/) and [ZK circuit
verifiers](https://veridise.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/VAR-RLN.pdf) being
proven with Coq. However, it is a lot of work formalize and prove real systems
and protocols, and proof assistants are used in much smaller scopes than what
Quint is set up for.

Proving something using one of these tools provides a much stronger guarantee
than verifying something with a model checker. Proof assistants are software and
thus can have bugs too, but they are generally more trustworthy than model
checkers because they usually rely on a small kernel implementing the core
logical rules. All proofs reduce to the rules in the kernel. The kernel is very
small, probably a few hundred lines of code, so it's easier to check and trust
that it faithfully implement the rules. Model checkers are much larger
implementations and, therefore, more prone to bugs.

While proof assistants enable very general proofs (such as `length(m) +
length(n) = length(m + n)`), model checkers will always operate over some
constraint state space (i.e. integers between 0 and 2^256).

Another difference is that these tools are able to generate code from the
formalization, meaning the code will be correct by construction. For example,
you can generate Haskell code from Coq. This is very useful if you want to
extract some sequential library, but code for distributed systems definitions
might not be so applicable to real world usage.

<FAQBox title="How does Quint compare to Agda/Idris?">

Agda and Idris are programming languages, while Quint is a specification
language. Even so, Agda and Idris are formal methods tools, because you can
write formal specification through dependent types, typing your program in a way
that guarantees it has a certain behavior.

They also work as proof systems (see ["How does Quint compare to
Coq/Isabelle/Lean?"](#how-does-quint-compare-to-coqisabellelean)) and,
similarly, they require a lot of expertise and time to prove things. Proving
through dependent types shifts some of this burden to the type system, but still
demand an advanced understanding. Model checking (as in Quint) will usually
provide weaker guarantees in comparison, but the proofs are fully automated.

Another difference is that programs in Agda and Idris need to be total - that
is, they need to terminate, and the writer may need to convince the type system
that in fact it does terminate every time.

<FAQBox title="How does Quint compare to Abstract State Machines?">

Abstract State Machines (ASMs) are a precise way to write pseudocode to define
the requirements of a system, and they are mostly used to reason about and
analyze designs, while Quint is more focused on executing and verifying
specifications.

This [report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10875) explores the differences and
similarities between Quint, TLA+ and ASM in more detail.

<FAQBox title="How does Quint compare to tools for specific programming languages?">

There is a big advantage and a big disadvantage for using some
formal verification tool designed for your programming language of choice instead of using Quint.
- Advantage: you don't have to write a Quint specification, you can use your own code
- Disadvantage: the verification capabilities will be extremely limited, because
  reasoning about generic programming language constructs and concrete program
  states is incredibly complex.

More generally, the state space of programs are often really large and
unfeasible for any tool to handle. The solution is to abstract things and work
on a higher level. Doing so in the same programming language is possible, but
can be tricky. Using a specific language to do so can help to keep a more
abstract mindset.

Anything you write in Quint is guaranteed to be compatible with the Temporal
Logic of Actions (TLA - the logic, not TLA+ the language), and therefore
verifiable with a model checker. If we were to try and translate arbitrary
programs to TLA, this would only support a fragment of the language that obeys
certain rules of the logic. This is also true for other verification techniques,
and that's why formal verification of generic programs is so limited.

</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How does Quint compare to static analyzers?">

Quint is used to reason about behaviors of programs and how things change over
time, and it does so by simulating or model checking executions. Static
analyzers, on the other hand, find problems *without* any execution of the
analyzed code, and only by looking at the code itself. A type checker is a
static analyzer. You can also have a static analyzer that flags every time
you write a division without checking that the divisor is not zero before -
which doesn't necessarily mean that a division by zero will happen in runtime.

If you can use a static analyzer to search for a class of errors (i.e.
null checks), you should definitely use that. Use Quint for what you cannot do
with a static analyzer (which is a lot!).

This is also one of the reasons why Quint has a type system. Although we could
check typing using invariants, as people often do in TLA+, we can do it
statically with a regular type checker - and that is much better.

Static analyzers won't be able to tell you if your consensus algorithm does
consensus as you expect, but Quint will. Also, trying to use static analyzers to
find complex problems usually results in many false positives, while model
checking doesn't have that problem - if it finds an issue, you'll get a
counterexample with a precise way of reproducing the problem.

<FAQBox title="What are spells?">
  Spells are simply Quint modules that contain often-used definitions. There is
  nothing special about these definitions. They are probably a bit more
  thought-out than a definition someone would write on the spot. Check the page
  on [Spells][].
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="What is the difference between pure def and def?">

Definitions that are tagged as `pure def` are not allowed to read state
variables (that is, the names declared with `var`). Definitions that are tagged
with `def` are allowed to read state variables, though they do not have to.

Pure definitions have the following important property: A **pure definition
always returns the same result for the same parameter values**.

Consider the following operator definition:

```quint
pure def min(x, y) = if (x < y) x else y
```

Whenever we call `min(2, 3)`, we get `2` as a result, no matter what the values of state variables are.

Impure definitions have the following important property:
**An impure definition may produce different results for the same parameter
values**. An impure definition **may read** the values of state variables, which
may affect in different results.

Consider the following definitions:

```quint
var limit: int

def minWithLimit(x, y) = min(min(x, y), limit)
```

In the above example, `minWithLimit(10, 20)` produces the value `10`, when
`limit == 100`, whereas `minWithLimit(10, 20)` produces the value `5`, when
`limit == 5`.

</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="What is the difference between val and def?">
The definitions that have at least one parameter should be tagged with `def`,
whereas the definitions that have no parameters should be tagged with `val`. We
could say that `val`'s are nullary `def`'s.

As a result, a `pure val` is never changing its value in an execution. For example:

```quint
pure val avogadro = 602214076^(23 - 8)
```

Note that an impure `val` may still depend on the value of a state variable.
For example:

```quint
var time: int
var velocity: int

val distance = velocity * time
```

In the above example, `distance` does not need any parameters, as it only
depends on the state variables. However, the value of `distance` is still
changing with the values of `time` and `velocity`.

</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="What is the difference between pure val and const?">
A value that is defined via `pure val` is constant in the sense that it never
changes in an execution. A `const` definition also declares a constant value.
However, the value of `const` is not fixed at the time of specification writing,
but it has to be fixed by instantiating the module.

Here is an example that illustrates the difference between `pure val` and `const`:

```quint
module fixed {
  // this module is written for N=4, e.g., for N processes
  pure val N = 4

  pure val procs = 1.to(N)
  // etc.
}

module parameterized {
  // this module is written for a parameter N
  const N: int

  pure val procs = 1.to(N)
  // etc.
}

module instance4 {
  import parameterized(N = 4) as I

  pure val procs = 1.to(I::N)
}
```
