# Learn the language with CodeTour Tutorials

We are introducing language tutorials in two formats.

## 1. Classic tutorials

These are simply tutorials written in Markdown. The only thing needed is your
browser. If you want to run the examples in REPL, check how to install
[Quint][].

These tutorials are currently available in the classic format:

 - [Hello, world!](./lessons/hello.md)
 - [Tutorial on Booleans](./lessons/booleans.md)
 - [Tutorial on integers](./lessons/integers.md)
 - [Tutorial on basic protocol anatomy and tests](./lessons/coin.md)
 - [Tutorial on sets](./lessons/sets.md)

## 2. CodeTour tutorials

If you like interactive language tutorials, we have recorded the above listed
tutorials using [CodeTour][]. You have to install two extensions:

 - [Quint VSCode][] is our language extension,
 - [CodeTour][] is the extension of replaying code tutorials.

To start a tour, open the [codetour](https://github.com/informalsystems/quint/tree/main/docs/codetour) folder in VSCode and start the tour:
